# NFL Weather Analysis

Analyzing the impact of weather on fantasy scores and betting results in the NFL since 2012.

All game and player data is scraped from [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/). All weather data is scraped from [NFLWeather.com](http://www.nflweather.com/).

BeautifulSoup and Pandas were used to scrape the data from the sites. I organized the data and calculated new metrics using Pandas and Numpy, and displayed in on a front-end using Flask. Chart.js was used to display all graphs.
